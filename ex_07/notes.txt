In this exercise you will have to start the looper. This program will print "Hello World" every 2 seconds, in
an infinite loop. Then you can attach the debugger by executing the "tracer" program.

Tracer will attach in remote process and retrieve data about the next instruction. Then you can
press enter to detach the remote process.
